  <h3>What We Do</h3><br>

       <p>
         Usually before we are assigned a project we undergo a series of lessons 
         of code that we need for the project. Our teacher, Mr.Mueller, uses resources like w3schools. 
         He even sometimes discovers new resources during his freetime. In SEP we also work in groups a.k.a 
         pair programming so if you don't like partner work this is not the program for you.

      <h3>How we do projects</h3>
      <div class="well">
        <p>
          In SEP we always get assigned a project based on what we've learned recently so there's no 
          catches in the projects but those "catches" can be turned into extra credit. In projects we are 
          usually assigned with a partner but rarely have independent projects. But in projects you always have to 
          look back at the rubric to meet all requirements, since this is a class we do need something to be graded on.
